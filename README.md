# karamudie.co.uk

This is a github site operated by photographer Kara Hood (Kara Mudie). It will run on jekyll, built and served by github pages. The current template is [photorama](https://github.com/sunbliss/photorama) by 
Anna Prigkipaki ([@sunbliss](https://github.com/sunbliss)).

It is currently under development, so expect to see things that don't make sense.
