## Template help information

If you want to use your **own domain** go to the root of your project's repository, create a CNAME file and add a line with your domain name, e.g. `www.yourdomain.com`.

Go to your domain name registrar and add a CNAME record pointing your domain to GitHub Pages:
- type: CNAME
- host: www.yourdomainname.com
- answer: yourusername.github.io/repositoryname
- TTL: 300

----------

**TAGS** and **CATEGORIES** of the posts 

When you add a tag or a category name in the front matter of a post, don't forget to add the responding markdown files in /journal/tag/ folder and in /journal/category folder, so they can always render when browsing the journal or searching in the respective page.
