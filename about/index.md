Hello. I am an Arts graduate and a former dancer and choreographer. I have post-graduate qualifications in primary and physical education. My key strengths are in creativity and an appreciation of the importance of our environments.

As a photographer, I like to focus on landscapes, seascapes and living things. I shoot mostly with the Fuji system. You can see some of my work here or on the social channels in the links below.
